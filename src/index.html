                I’m a 29-year-old software engineer raised in Saskatoon and based in Vancouver. Drawn by the mountains,
                you can find me enjoying them through my 4K monitor behind 23 browser tabs and a half finished project.
                Out of the house, you'll find me shelled into my homelab, grabbing a coffee at a trendy cafe, soaking up
                the sun on a paddleboard, or shredding fresh snow on my snowboard. When it’s rainy, you’ll find me at the
                gym getting my cardio in.

              <p class="tab">
                With years of experience in web development and system administration, I manage a custom-built,
                rack-mounted server running Ubuntu Server that hosts multiple Docker services. Some publicly accessible
                through my domain, while others are secured behind a WireGuard VPN. Everything is routed through
                Traefik as a reverse proxy, and I use Grafana and Prometheus with various exporters for monitoring and
                performance tracking. For networking, I have an Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE with access points throughout
                my home. I use Cloudflare to manage my domains and handle dynamic DNS updates, ensuring my A records
                are automatically updated when my public IP changes.

                I love blending creativity with functionality. Beyond my passion for technology, I'm also passionate
                about automotives and love getting dirty in the garage. I have a Mustang with a fully built engine,
                sporting a V8 and 76mm turbo running 16psi of boost on 94 octane fuel with water methanol injection.
                Whether it be a simple oil change, a transmission swap, or replacing a head gasket, I'm always eager to
                twist some wrenches.

                I'm also enthusiastic about home automation, where I used an ESP32 to implement the HDMI-CEC protocol to
                turn an old TV into a smart TV controllable through Home Assistant. I've also used an ESP8266 with an IR
                emitter to control my fan remotely, and to trigger a relay opening my garage door communicating through
                an MQTT broker. Being interested in audio, I've also installed a full Sonos multiroom home audio system
                with speakers in every room. My interest doesn't stop in the home, where I've also installed a
                Focal audio system in my car with a digital signal processor and amplifier.

                  Engineered a real-time voting platform with live results displayed on jumbotrons for large venues.
                  Deployed by companies including Ticketmaster and Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment for fan engagement,
                  data collection, analytics and sales leads.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Refactored the platform’s outgoing integrations system, enabling customizable pushed fields for
                  various APIs, including Oracle, Attentive, Campaign Monitor, Marketo, and ExactTarget, allowing for
                  flexible mapping to different fields on each platform. The new architecture streamlined data
                  synchronization and reduced configuration complexity across clients.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Developed a customizable and themeable call-to-action link page generator for ticket vendors to
                  promote upcoming concert dates, with built-in tracking for user ticket purchases and reservations.

                  Maintained a key role in converting the platform’s campaign builder to an in-house custom single-page
                  application infrastructure, leading to improved cache compatibility, database performance, and user
                  experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Engineered an interactive client-engagement campaign that allowed users to upload text, images, and
                  videos, with integrated voting and download features. The platform generated hundreds of thousands of
                  entries and was used by global brands such as NASCAR.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reworked the platform’s language localization system and user interface, enabling default language
                  settings with flexible options to add or remove languages and apply specific overrides per campaign
                  or business. These enhancements provided teams with greater control over multilingual content and
                  simplified localization workflows.
