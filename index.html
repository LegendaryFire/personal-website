            I'm a twenty-seven-year-old software developer, born and raised
            under the vast prairie skies of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, who made
            the move to Vancouver, British Columbia, drawn by the allure of its
            stunning natural beauty and vibrant tech scene. My passion and
            dedication to technology knows no bounds, as I continuously find
            myself studying new programming languages and paradigms. I kicked
            off my software journey by diving into the realms of Visual Basic 6,
            and later progressed my way to Python, Java, C++ and beyond.

              Starting with the basic fundamentals such as the 'print'
              statement, I've leveled up my skills to use popular web libraries
              and frameworks like Express.js, React, Django, and more. However,
              my interest doesn't stop at web development. As a dedicated gamer,
              I'm deeply interested in game development and find joy in
              exploring the intricacies of Unreal Engine. Continuing my studies,
              I delved into the development to deployment lifecycle, where I
              learned to master the practice of containerization with Docker.
              Presently, I employ Docker to orchestrate a multitude of web
              services, each accessible through a public domain utilizing a
              reverse proxy configuration.

          <hr />
          <p class="tab">
            Beyond my enthusiasm for technology, I'm passionate about the
            outdoors and frequently engage in activities like hiking, biking,
            and snowboarding. During the weekdays, you'll often find me at the
            gym, either in the early morning or evening. Additionally, I'm a
            devoted coffee and tea enthusiast, constantly seeking out the
            trendiest cafes in the area. My favorite cup of caffeine is a
            cortado with oat milk, closely followed by white peach oolong tea.
            Always open to recommendations, feel free to hit me with your best
            shotâ€”whether it's a latte, a mocha, or something more adventurous.

              Coming from a household that valued hands-on skills, I immersed
              myself in automotive mechanics from a tender age. One of my
              proudest accomplishments is custom building a high-performance
              Mustang engine capable of delivering 700 horsepower, boosted by a
              formidable 76mm turbocharger. Many would describe me as
              kind-hearted, dedicated, and perpetually open-minded, always eager
              to learn. I thrive in collaborative settings and excel at working
              effectively within teams, as well as on my own.
