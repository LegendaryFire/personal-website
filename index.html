            I’m a twenty-seven-year-old software developer, born and raised
            under the vast prairie skies of Saskatoon Saskatchewan. My passion
            and dedication to technology knows no bounds, as I continuously find
            myself studying new programming languages and paradigms. I kicked
            off my software journey by diving into the realms of Visual Basic 6,
            and later progressed my way to Python, Java, C++ and beyond.

              Starting with the basic fundamentals such as the 'print' statement,
              I've leveled up my skills to use popular web libraries and
              frameworks like Express.js, React, Django, and more. However, my
              interest doesn't stop at web development. As a dedicated gamer, I'm
              deeply interested in game development and find joy in exploring the
              intricacies of Unreal Engine. Continuing my studies, I delved into
              the development to deployment lifecycle, where I learned to master
              the practice of containerization with Docker. Presently, I employ
              Docker to orchestrate a multitude of web services, each accessible
              through a public domain utilizing a reverse proxy configuration.

          <hr />
          <p class="tab">
            Beyond my enthusiasm for technology, I'm passionate about the
            outdoors and frequently engage in activities like hiking, biking,
            and snowboarding. During the weekdays, you'll often find me at the
            gym, either in the early morning or evening. Additionally, I'm a
            devoted coffee and tea enthusiast, constantly seeking out the
            trendiest cafes in the area. My favorite cup of caffeine is a
            cortado with oat milk, closely followed by white peach oolong tea.
            Always open to recommendations, feel free to hit me with your best
            shot—whether it's a latte, a mocha, or something more adventurous.

              Coming from a household that valued hands-on skills, I immersed
              myself in automotive mechanics from a tender age. One of my proudest
              accomplishments is custom building a high-performance Mustang engine
              capable of delivering 700 horsepower, boosted by a formidable 76mm
              turbocharger. Many would describe me as kind-hearted, dedicated, and
              perpetually open-minded, always eager to learn. I thrive in
              collaborative settings and excel at working effectively within
              teams, as well as on my own.
