        <h2>Welcome to my portfolio.</h2>
        <hr />
        <p class="tab">
          I am a 27-year-old software developer residing in Vancouver, British
          Columbia, drawn by its stunning natural beauty and vibrant tech scene.
          My passion and dedication to technology knows no bounds, as I
          continuously find myself studying new programming languages and
          paradigms. I kicked off my software journey by diving into the realms
          of Python and progressed my way to JavaScript, Java, C#, C++ and beyond.
        </p>
        <div id="welcome" class="collapse">
          <p class="tab">
            Starting with the print statement, I've leveled up my skills to use
            popular web frameworks like Express.js, React and Django. As an avid
            gamer, my interest doesn't stop at web development. I invest my spare
            time in learning Unreal Engine and have knowledge in both blueprints
            and C++. Additionally, I am proficient in Docker, using it to streamline
            my development process and deploy applications efficiently.

        <h2>A little more about me.</h2>
        <hr />
        <p class="tab">
          Beyond my passion for technology, you'll often find me exploring the outdoors
          either hiking, biking or snowboarding. As a devoted coffee and tea enthusiast,
          you can also find me seeking out the trendiest cafes in the area. My favorite
          cup of cup of caffeine is a cortado with oat milk, closely followed by a white
          peach oolong tea. Always open to recommendations, feel free to hit me with your
          best shot-whether it's a latte, a mocha or something more adventurous.
        </p>
        <div id="about" class="collapse">
          <p class="tab">
            In addition to my professional pursits, I enjoy turning old electronics into smart
            devices with the help of microcontrollers. With an ESP32 and the HDMI-CEC protocol,
            I managed to turn an outdated TV into a smart device controllable from my phone.
            I was also able to build a smart fan using an IR blaster allowing me to control
            the power state, speed and timer.

        <h2>django-responsive-tables2</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This Django package is intended to add functionality to the already
          outstanding django_tables2 library. Using this package, you'll be
          able to easily implement responsive full-text search capabilities,
          pagination and more. Although a default bootstrap template is
          included, this library allows for customization, and a template can
          be used to theme the table however required.

        <h2>edge-runlist-builder</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This tool automates building vehicle runlists for the Edge Pipeline
          auction sales platform. This tool uses Selenium to pull presale
          auction data to match with owned units on the point of sales for
          easy calculation of breakeven costs, reserve/line prices, source of
          purchasing and more. This tool copies the table it generates into
          the clipboard, so it can be easily entered in Microsoft Teams or an
          Excel document.

        <h2>sonos-controller</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This app serves as a controller for your Sonos multiroom audio
          system using Python. Using sonos-controller you'll be able to
          control the volume of your Sonos zones using the native media keys
          on your keyboard. Hotkeys can be changed, and players can be added
          or removed by modifying the XML configuration file.

        <h2>kijiji-scraper</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This scraper is a web crawler which provides a way to receive new
          listing notifications sooner than the ones from Kijiji which are
          only sent daily (once every 24-hours). This scraper also increases
          the functionality with bump and price change notifications.
          Notifications are sent using Pushover, and include a title, short
          description, image, price, phone number (if applicable) and a link
          to the ad.
